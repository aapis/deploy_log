# DeployLog

Get all Github pull requests for a specific timeframe, or search by title/branch name.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'deploy_log'
```

And then execute:

> $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

## Usage

First, make sure your Github username and a [personal access token](https://github.com/settings/tokens) are setup as follows:

```bash

```

Search in any valid date range.

```bash
$ deploy_log my/repo --start=2019-06-11 --end=2019-06-12

To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
